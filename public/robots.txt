🔧 What would you like to build next?

Here are the key options based on your flow:
1. 🔁 Swap Deals Page

    Users see available iPhone swap options (e.g. swap iPhone X + GHS 1500 for iPhone 11).

    Can click to request a swap (no login needed).

    Request gets saved for admin review.

2. 🔧 Repair Request System

    User fills a form: device type, issue description, contact info.

    Admin sees request and replies/approves.

    System assigns a repair tag and pickup/delivery date.

    Admin can later mark it as fixed.

3. 🛒 Order / Checkout Page

    Users select products → choose delivery/pickup → place order.

    Order is saved to DB; admin gets notified.

4. 🧑‍💻 Admin Panel

    Add/edit/delete products

    View orders, repair requests, swap requests

    Upload images

💬 Which one would you like to do now?

Type:

    swap → to start Swap Deals

    repair → for Repair Flow

    order → for Cart & Checkout

    admin → for Admin Dashboard

Let’s build it module by module.
